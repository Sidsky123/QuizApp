This app was designed with regards to the specifications provided in Mobile Commerce Course at the University of Ottawa.

The objective of this part of the assignment is to gain experience in the design and implementation of an Android application that interacts with the user. You are allowed to develop the application using Kotlin (no additional tools).
Your team is tasked with developing a gamming application. The user of your application should be able to:
1. See an opening page (screen1) that is a welcome page with the University of Ottawa logo and a welcome message: “Welcome to X’s game” where X represents the team members names. The screen will also have an OK button to end the welcome page.
2. Once the user hits ok, they are introduced to a new screen (screen2) with three buttons (you can replace the screen with a menu if you prefer): One to start a game (you will choose to implement game A or game B below), a second to show the score of the last game, the third is used to go back to the welcome screen.
3. Choose to implement one of those two games:
- Game A: a quiz game (question and multiple choice game), ---SELECTED
-( Game B: A count the sheep game --- NOT SELECTED)
4. The Show score button, shows the score of the last game played for Games A and B (Screen3). Then goes back to the 3-buttons screen (Screen2) .
5. If you choose to implement Game A: Store 20 multiple choice questions (MCQs) (trivia about movies, news, general knowledge, etc.), in arrays (one for the questions, one for each of the multiple choices (a, b, and c) and one that stores the correct answer index 1 for a, 2 for b and 3 for c). When the game is started (Screen3), randomly select 4 multiple choice questions displayed one at a time with an Ok button ( you can add a timer if you: want 10 secs to answer a question).
a. The user scores 1 point for each correct question and 0 for wrong answer.
b. Each new question has a different screen color.
c. The user sees the answers after the game is over (with the wrong answers highlighted).
d. Return to screen2 at the end.

Some bonus (optional features) each adds one mark ( to recover any missed marks in the assignment).
1. Allow the user to add questions to game A.
2. Allow the user to select and/or upload a different animal each time.
3. Keep a score even after the user exits.
4. Add a musical background.
